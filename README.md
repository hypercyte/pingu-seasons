# Java project

This game was made as the final project for my Java programming module in my first year of university. There is lots that could be improved but I'm happy with how this came out, as my first big java project!

I tried to create a .jar if anyone wants to try running it but I'm not sure if it worked.

This was made using my university's own game engine (CityEngine) but I'm not sure if I can share it here along with my project.
