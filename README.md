# Java game project

This game was made as the final project for my Java programming module in my first year of university. There is lots that could be improved but I'm happy with how this came out, as my first big java project!

This was made using my university's own game engine (CityEngine) but I'm not sure if I can share it here along with my project.

## Instructions

1. Download the latest `.zip` from the project [Releases](https://github.com/hypercyte/pingu-seasons/releases/tag/1.0.1).
2. Extract the zip file wherever you want
3. Run `game.exe` and *(try to)* enjoy! :'D

## How to play

There is **local multiplayer** support (using the same keyboard), but can be played as **singleplayer** just fine.

### Controls

- **WASD** - Player 1 controls.
- **Arrow keys** - Player 2 controls.

### Instructions

- Eat the **fish** to gain energy.
- **Wood** requires at least **2** units of **combined energy** between both players.
- **Metal** is similar and requires **4** units.
- Getting hit by **Sharp Ice** and **Skunks** will damage the player(s).
- If either player dies, it is game over. (Game closes itself, you will need to re-open to retry.)

### Objective

- Reach the **Goal** on each map (Depicted as a green flag).
- There are **3** maps.
- Clear all maps and win! (And recieve the satisfying reward of the game closing itself! (im sorry))
